## What is VIDAA

**VIDAA (Video Instant Distribution & Assemble Automation)** — and note, “VIDA” means “life” in Portuguese.

VIDAA is an all-in-one platform for video creation and distribution. It leverages large model capabilities to generate simple videos on specified themes and enables one-click publishing to major domestic video platforms.

## Why Build VIDAA

As an AI infrastructure engineer, I work with large models daily—mainly focusing on model adaptation, performance tuning, and development for specific hardware platforms. However, I’ve always felt that my knowledge of the application layer is somewhat lacking.

VIDAA is my first AI application project. I aim to use this project as an opportunity to delve deeper into the potential of large models in practical video content creation while also revisiting the full-stack development skills I honed before switching careers.

## Getting Started

This project adopts a decoupled front-end and back-end architecture. Please refer to the README files in the respective subdirectories for detailed instructions on how to run each component.
